- Requirements
  - Build a set of simple physics puzzles that rely on 2D transformations and demonstrate the use of various shapes appropriately.
  - Transformations that must be utilized to solve the puzzles:
    - Scaling, Shearing, Translation, Rotation and combinations of these.
  - Must use simple shapes (i.e. Squares, Rectangles, Circles) as well as have general polygons (convex) to solve the puzzle.
  - Must require the user to solve the puzzle using the transformations
  - You may use Box2D for this assignment.
